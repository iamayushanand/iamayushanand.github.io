Hi,

Today I will be discussing about differentiation and integration as it is in my school syllabus for the shuffling test.

<b><i>Differentiation:- </i></b>

Differention is a tool which we use to find the slope in a ""non linear"" graph.

let us recall the definition of slope of a linear graph.



![slope equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?slope=\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0} "slope equation: ")

where x is any constant and y<sub>0</sub> = f(x<sub>0</sub>) and same for y<sub>1</sub>.

f(x) is a function which takes x as a input and gives it's y coordinate as an output. The slope at any point of a linear equation is always the same however that is not the case in a ""non linear equation"" for e.g sin x, cos x, x^2 , etc . As we can't find slope of the whole graph accurately we can find an approx. or average slope between A and B using the same formula.

The average slope will be close to the actual slope but it will not be exact and accurate and sometimes it maynot be close at all however if we keep decreasing the distance between A and B we will get closer and closer to the slope at particular point and this is where limit kicks in.

the basic idea of limit is that one can approach a specific destination but never reach there. Look at the graph below for an example :-

The above graph demonstrates limits.Notice that the blue points are getting closer and closer to some value x where they converge however they will not reach that point but they can approach it.

for example 0.9, 0.99, 0.999,0.9999,0.99999 is a convergent series and it approaches one but it will never reach 1.

So now let us think what will happen if we keep decreasing the interval length.

![Average_slope](https://share.ehs.uen.org/sites/default/files/images/M1_unit7l3.3_image1.img_assist_custom.png "Average slope")

in the above image the slope of green line represents the average slope between points x=-2 and x=2.

what if we wanted the average slope between -1 and 1. If we did then that average slope will be more closer to the actual slope at a particular point thus we take the limit as we can make the interval infinitesimally small.

So our diffrentiation formula at a point x is:-

![Differentiation between points x<sub>0</sub> and x<sub>1</sub>](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\lim_{x_1-x_0&space;\to&space;0&space;}&space;\frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0} "Differentiation between two points")


Now to make our lifes easier mathematicians said that we do not need to use those formulas  instead we could develop simpler functions out of the f(x) which can determine the derivative at point x. We denote this function as f'(x) or the dervative of f(x). 

So here are some of the common f'(x) of f(x):
