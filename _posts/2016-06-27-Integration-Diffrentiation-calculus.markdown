Hi,

Today I will be discussing about differentiation and integration as it is in my school syllabus for the shuffling test.

<b><i>Differentiation:- </i></b>

Differention is a tool which we use to find the slope in a ""non linear"" graph.

let us recall the definition of slope of a linear graph.



![slope equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?slope=\frac{y_1-y_0}{x_1-x_0} "slope equation: ")

where x is any constant and y_0 = f(x_0) and same for y_1.

f(x) is a function which takes x as a input and gives it's y coordinate as an output. The slope at any point of a linear equation is always the same however that is not the case in a ""non linear equation"" for e.g sin x, cos x, x^2 , etc . As we can't find slope of the whole graph accurately we can find an approx. or average slope between A and B using the same formula.

The average slope will be close to the actual slope but it will not be exact and accurate and sometimes it maynot be close at all however if we keep decreasing the distance between A and B we will get closer and closer to the slope at particular point.
