			<h1>How I breached three coaching platforms and a national level exam(nse's)?</h1>
			<h2>On security of sites</h2>
			<p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You could implement the best of the best cryptographic algorimiths put up an SSL protocol etc, and yet
			be insecure simply because the programmers did not think the design of the site and its architecture seriously.A simple unchecked https request can open up a lot of vulnerabilities. In this post I explain how i breached the websites of three major coaching and provide the fix for them.Security of websites till this day remains neglected in a lot of sites.There was no particular motivation in doing this I just like to experiment on the sites I go on and just open up the dev tools and check them out.</p>
			<h2>Vibrant</h2>
			<p>Vibrant had recently opened up an online platform for giving tests and stuff related to that.Being a student of the same institution the student logins were indeed given to us. The trick lied in getting the <b>administrator login</b>. Here is the thing: the site simply wasnt checking if you are a student or not if you had the right URL for the admin console and could somehow enter that with the student login it would open up. So all you had to do was change the "dashboard/" in the url with "admindashboard/" and bingo!!</p>
