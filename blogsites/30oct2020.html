			<h1>How I breached three coaching platforms and a national level exam(nse's)?</h1>
			<h2>On security of sites</h2>
			<p>A chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You could implement the best of the best cryptographic algorimiths put up an SSL protocol etc, and yet
			be insecure simply because the programmers did not think the design of the site and its architecture seriously.A simple unchecked https request can open up a lot of vulnerabilities. In this post I explain how i breached the websites of three major coaching and provide the fix for them.Security of websites till this day remains neglected in a lot of sites.There was no particular motivation in doing this I just like to experiment on the sites I go on and just open up the dev tools and check them out.</p>
			<h2>Vibrant</h2>
			<p>Vibrant had recently opened up an online platform for giving tests and stuff related to that.Being a student of the same institution the student logins were indeed given to us. The trick lied in getting the <b>administrator login</b>. Here is the thing: the site simply wasnt checking if you are a student or not if you had the right URL for the admin console and could somehow enter that with the student login it would open up. So all you had to do was change the "dashboard/" in the url with "admindashboard/" and bingo!!</p>
			<img class="img-fluid w-25 h-50" src="http://iamayushanand.github.io/assets/images/30oct2020/picone.jpeg" alt="admin access">
			<p>Worse yet is the fact that the APIs even tho they do check weather or not the person is a member of the organisation do not check if they are student or admins. This allows me the freedom to even send messages(SMS) directly from the vibrant winuall servers.All you had to do was go to the broadcast message option in admin console and then view the http packet that gets sent.</p>
			<img class="img-fluid w-25 h-50" src="http://iamayushanand.github.io/assets/images/30oct2020/pictwo.jpeg" alt="Messaging">
			<p>and then you can modify it as you want!!.</p>
			<h3>The fix</h3>
			<p>The admin consoles should not have been linked with the student consoles directly and proper checks should have been put in place.When I pointed this out the site was taken down as can be evident now and it is not in use. The other platform which is now developed vibrant phoenix has its own share of security flaws which is a topic of later time and will be addressed.Here we see how despite all the low level precautions like using ssl the site was insecure because of a design flaw.</p>
			<h2>Allen</h2>
			<p>This one was a bit more complicated than the others.This one handled a lot of server side things via frontend itself using ajax calls without verifications at the server side.Hence all you had to do was modify and forge those particular http requests and you will be given the info you need.</p>

			<p>(ofcourse the session would've expired by now)The above code gives you the question paper data and their answers in a json format. This could have been avoided by say a check at the server of allen? This is a design flaw!</p>
			<p>A lot of students register on allen and their data is vulnerable due to such design flaws</p>

			<p>The code above can fetch marks of any student given the exam no. and his application number which is easily available.</p>
			<h2>Fiitjee</h2>
			<p>I could not find a lot of flaws in it apart from the fact that mobile otps are only 4 digits and they dont expire hence allows a potential attacker to try out all combos programatically. Another flaw is that after the login in the profile page passwords are stored as plaintext instead of a hash thats some real bad programming practice.</p>
